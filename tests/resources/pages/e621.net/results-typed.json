They've just about all been turned into apartment houses now. When Bertie got his breath he told us Richie lived on the third floor under that top gable that jutted out like an eyebrow. I took the chance to ask Henry what happened to the kid after that.\r\n\r\nAlong about the third week in November the kid came back one afternoon to find Richie had gone one further than just pulling the shades down. He'd taken and nailed blankets across every window in the place. It was starting to stink worse, too - kind of a mushy stink, the way fruit gets when it goes to ferment with yeast.\r\n\r\nA week or so after that, Richie got the kid to start heating his beer on the stove. Can you feature that? The kid all by himself in that apartment with his dad turning into, well, into something . . . an' heating his beer and then having to listen to him - it - drinking it with awful thick slurping sounds, the way an old man eats his chowder: Can you imagine it?\r\n\r\nAnd that's the way things went on until today, when the kid's school let out early because of the storm.\r\n\r\n'The boy says he went right home,' Henry told us. 'There's no light in the upstairs hall at all - the boy claims his dad musta snuck out some night and broke it - so he had to sort of creep down to his door.\r\n\r\n'Well, he heard somethin' moving around in there, and it suddenly pops into his mind that he don't know what Richie does all day through the week. He ain't seen his dad stir out of that chair for almost a month, and a man's got to sleep and go to the bathroom some time.\r\n\r\n[/quote]","created_at":{"json_class":"Time","s":1501354382,"n":954564000},"creator_id":126947,"author":"llorando","change":11240623,"source":"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10221369/","score":-1,"fav_count":2,"md5":"c00a88b4afe6fa232de2695ddae69da6","file_size":759459,"file_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/c0/0a/c00a88b4afe6fa232de2695ddae69da6.png","file_ext":"png","preview_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/preview/c0/0a/c00a88b4afe6fa232de2695ddae69da6.jpg","preview_width":150,"preview_height":150,"sample_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/sample/c0/0a/c00a88b4afe6fa232de2695ddae69da6.jpg","sample_width":800,"sample_height":800,"rating":"s","status":"pending","width":1000,"height":1000,"has_comments":false,"has_notes":false,"has_children":false,"children":"","parent_id":null,"artist":["aggrobadger"],"sources":["https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10221369/","https://www.furaffinity.net/user/vykos/","https://d.facdn.net/art/vykos/1364311755/1364311755.vykos_32-1603-devlin.png"]},{"id":1289694,"tags":{"general":["clothing","clothed","female","male","fur","text","english_text","digital_media_(artwork)","digital_drawing_(artwork)","comic","anthro"],"artist":["dosent"],"copyright":[],"character":[],"species":["rodent","squirrel","lagomorph","rabbit","mammal"]},"locked_tags":null,"description":"Page 4!

Timmy asks, for Richie don't hardly ever roll in before nine.\r\n\r\n'I'm watchin' the TV,' Richie says. 'I didn't seem to want to go out today.'\r\n\r\nTimmy turned on the light over the sink, and Richie yelled at him: 'And turn off that friggin' light!'\r\n\r\nSo Timmy did, not asking how he's gonna do his homework in the dark. When Richie's in that mood, you don't ask him nothing.\r\n\r\n'An' go out an' get me a case,' Richie says. 'Money's on the table.'\r\n\r\nWhen the kid gets back, his dad's still sitting in the dark, only now it's dark outside, too. And the TV's off. The kid starts getting the creeps well, who wouldn't? Nothing but a dark flat and your daddy setting in the corner like a big lump.\r\n\r\nSo he puts the beer on the table, knowing that Richie don't like it so cold it spikes his forehead, and when he gets close to his old man he starts to notice a kind of rotten smell, like an old cheese someone left standing on the counter over the weekend. He don't say shit or go blind, though, as the old man was never what you'd call a cleanly soul. Instead he goes into his room and shuts the door and does his homework, and after a while he hears the TV start to go and Richie's popping the top in his first of the evening.\r\n\r\nAnd for two weeks or so, that's the way things went. The kid got up in the morning and went to school an' when he got home Richie'd be in front of the television, and beer money on the table.\r\n\r\nThe flat was smelling ranker and ranker, too. Richie wouldn't have the shades up at all, and about the middle of November he made Timmy stop studying in his room. Said he couldn't abide the light under the door. So Timmy started going down the block to a friend's house after getting his dad the beer.\r\n\r\nThen one day when Timmy came home from school - it was four o'clock and pretty near dark already - Richie says, 'Turn on the light.'\r\n\r\nThe kid turned on the light over the sink, and damn if Richie ain't all wrapped up in a blanket.\r\n\r\n'Look,' Richie says, and one hand creeps out from under the blanket. Only it ain't a hand at all. Something grey, is all the kid could tell Henry. Didn't look like a hand at all. Just a grey lump.\r\n\r\nWell, Timmy Grenadine was scared bad. He says, 'Pop, what's happening to you?'\r\n\r\nAnd Richie says, 'I dunno. But it don't hurt. It feels. . kinda nice.'\r\n\r\nSo, Timmy says, 'I'm gonna call Dr Westphail.'\r\n\r\nAnd the blanket starts to tremble all over, like something awful was shaking - all over- under there. And Richie says, 'Don't you dare. If you do I'll touch ya and you'll end up just like this.' And he slides the blanket down over his face for just a minute.\r\n\r\n[/quote]","created_at":{"json_class":"Time","s":1501354018,"n":507090000},"creator_id":126947,"author":"llorando","change":11240587,"source":"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10170369/","score":0,"fav_count":1,"md5":"50c27dbd0e97235549895a7b77c42a66","file_size":639204,"file_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/50/c2/50c27dbd0e97235549895a7b77c42a66.png","file_ext":"png","preview_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/preview/50/c2/50c27dbd0e97235549895a7b77c42a66.jpg","preview_width":150,"preview_height":150,"sample_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/sample/50/c2/50c27dbd0e97235549895a7b77c42a66.jpg","sample_width":800,"sample_height":800,"rating":"s","status":"pending","width":1000,"height":1000,"has_comments":false,"has_notes":false,"has_children":false,"children":"","parent_id":null,"artist":["aggrobadger"],"sources":["https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10170369/","https://www.furaffinity.net/user/aggrobadger/","https://d.facdn.net/art/aggrobadger/1363733045/1363733045.aggrobadger_30-1603-devlin.png"]},{"id":1289688,"tags":{"general":["grey_goo","sitting_on_bed","5_fingers","white_shirt","blue_pants","frown","green_eyes","bottle","holding_bottle","anthro","simple_background","open_mouth","black_nose","slime","annoyed","watching_tv","digitigrade","barefoot","beer_bottle","holding_object","pants","jeans","clothing","shirt","tank_top","sofa","male","solo"],"artist":["aggrobadger"],"copyright":["stephen_king"],"character":[],"species":["mammal","canine","coyote"]},"locked_tags":null,"description":"Stephen King's \"[i]Grey Matter[/i]\" as short comic by [b]Aggrobader[/b]/[b]Vykos[/b]\r\n\r\nPage 2/7 \"[b]Worst Taste Ever[/b]\"\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n\r\nThe kid said it must have been the beer - you know how you can get a bad can every now and again. Flat or smelly or green as the peestains in an Irishman's underwear. A fella once told me that all it takes is a tiny hole to let in bacteria that'll do some damn strange things. The hole can be so small that the beer won't hardly dribble out, but the bacteria can get in. And beer's good food for some of those bugs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the kid said Richie brought back a case of Golden Light just like always that night in October and sat down to polish it off while Timmy did his homework.\r\n\r\nTimmy was just about ready for bed when he hears Richie say, 'Christ Jesus, that ain't right.'\r\n\r\nAnd Timmy says, 'What's that, Pop?'\r\n\r\n'That beer,' Richie says. 'God, that's the worst taste I ever had in my mouth.'\r\n\r\nMost people would wonder why in the name of God he drank it if it tasted so bad, but then, most people have never seen Richie Grenadine go to his beer. I was down in Wally's Spa one afternoon, and I saw him win the goddamndest bet. He bet a fella he could drink twenty two-bit glasses of beer in one minute. Nobody local would take him up, but this salesman from Montpelier laid down a twenty-dollar Bill and Richie covered him. He drank all twenty with seven seconds to spare - although when he walked out he was more'n three sails into the wind. So I expect Richie had most of that bad can in his gut before his brain could warn him.\r\n\r\n'I'm gonna puke,' Richie say. 'Look out!'\r\n\r\nBut by the time he got to the head it had passed off, and that was the end of it. The boy said he smelt the can, and it smeltlike something crawled in there and died. There was a little grey dribble around the top, too.\r\n\r\n[/quote]","created_at":{"json_class":"Time","s":1501353785,"n":781614000},"creator_id":126947,"author":"llorando","change":11240590,"source":"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10169790/","score":1,"fav_count":3,"md5":"751b9d8d1e5161aed68d323eaf7e9794","file_size":623083,"file_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/75/1b/751b9d8d1e5161aed68d323eaf7e9794.png","file_ext":"png","preview_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/preview/75/1b/751b9d8d1e5161aed68d323eaf7e9794.jpg","preview_width":150,"preview_height":150,"sample_url":"https://static1.e621.net/data/sample/75/1b/751b9d8d1e5161aed68d323eaf7e9794.jpg","sample_width":800,"sample_height":800,"rating":"s","status":"pending","width":1000,"height":1000,"has_comments":false,"has_notes":false,"has_children":false,"children":"","parent_id":null,"artist":["aggrobadger"],"sources":["https://www.furaffinity.net/view/10169790/","https://www.furaffinity.net/user/aggrobadger/","https://d.facdn.net/art/aggrobadger/1363729062/1363729062.aggrobadger_29-1603-devlin.png"]}]
