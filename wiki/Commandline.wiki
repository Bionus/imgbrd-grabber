  # Go to "Start > Run", put "cmd" then press ok.
  # Go to the installation folder using the "cd" command (example: "cd C:/Program Files/Grabber"). If you installed the program on another drive than C:, just add the "/D" paramter (example: "cd /D E:/Programs/Grabber").
  # Now, you can launch the application, and all its paramters, that we are going to study now.

  * --booru (-b): the booru you want to use (you can use multiple boorus separating them with spaces)
  * --limit (-l): the maximum amount of files the program can download.
  * --page (-s): the first page
  * --path (-p): where you want to save pictures
  * --filename (-f): the saving format (see the options window)
