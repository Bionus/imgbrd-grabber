#summary Keep a local gelbooru to browse your downloaded images.

= Introduction =
First of all, know that using commands can slow down huge batch downloads (a recent computer may need from 100ms to 1s more per image, which is very consequent).

_Note: in this wiki, I'll consider that you're using Windows. But on Linux & other OSes, it should be pretty the same (use the cp command instead of copy, LAMP (linux) / MAMP (mac) instead of WAMP, etc.)._



= Installing a local web server =

First, we're going to install WAMP, which contains everithing required to have a local web server.

 # Download the latest version of WampServer here (2.2e as I am writing this): [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/]
 # Install it somewhere that doesn’t requires admin rights to write into (for example, the default location c:\wamp)
 # At the end of the installation, the installer may ask for two things.
  # First, he will ask you what your favorite browser is. You can leave it to the default value which will be Internet Explorer, or change it to another browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).
  # Finally, he will ask some email settings. Leave the default values, you don’t care about that.
 # Now that WampServer is installed, you should see a little green W in your system tray, near the clock (you may need to expand the tray to see it).
 # Congratulations! You can visit your local server by going to [http://localhost/ here]!



= Installing Gelbooru =

 # Download the latest version of Gelbooru here (0.1.10 as I am writing this): [http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=forum&s=view&id=99]
 # Extract it to the www directory in your WampServer installation folder. You can either extract it to a subfolder or not. If you extract it to a subfolder, the site’s url will be [http://localhost/subfolder/], and if you don’t it will only be [http://localhost/]. It’s your choice, but if you don’t create a subfolder, you must remember to remove all the files in your www folder first. For the end of this tutorial, I’ll consider that you are using the subfolder "gelbooru".
 # Create a folder named "1" in the "images" folder.
 # If you are using linux, give the "images", "images/1" and "thumbnails" folders writable permissions.
 # Then, go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/]. If you have to login, use "root" as username and "" as password (no password).
 # Then, go to the databases tab and create a database named "gelbooru" with an "utf8_unicode_ci" encoding.
   Once done, Go to the "SQL" tab, and put this query in the text area:
{{{
SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
}}}
   Click "Go".
 # Then, open the file "config.php" with a plain text editor (I don’t recommend using a WYSIWYG editor such as word).
   <table cellpadding="3"><tr><td border="2">*Replace the line*</td><td>*By*</td></tr><tr><td>`$mysql_pass = "test";`</td><td>`$mysql_pass = "";`</td></tr><tr><td>`$mysql_db = "asdf";`</td><td>`$mysql_db = "gelbooru";`</td></tr><tr><td>`$site_url = "http://127.0.0.1/branches/0.1.10/0.1.10/";`</td><td>`$site_url = "http://localhost/gelbooru";`</td></tr><tr><td>`$site_url3 = "Default Booru";`</td><td>`$site_url2 = $site_url3 = "Localbooru";`</td></tr></table>
   (you can change "Localbooru" to anything: it will be the name of the booru)
 # And finally add, just before the "?>" at the end of the file:
{{{
$lowerlimit = 20;
$no_cache = false;
$tag_count = 20;
$new_tag_list = 'iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii';
$new_user_list = 'iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii';
$new_cthreshold = 0;
$new_pthreshold = 0;
$new_my_tags = '';
error_reporting(0);
}}}
  You can of course change these values to whatever you want.
 # Go to [http://localhost/gelbooru/install/] and register your admin account.
 # If you don’t see any errors the installation went well! As the script suggests, you can now delete the c:\wamp\www\gelbooru\install folder.
 # Finally, go to phpMyAdmin, click on the "gelbooru" database on the left menu, then click on the "SQL" tab, and put this query in the text area:
{{{
ALTER TABLE `tag_index` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`tag`)
}}}
   Click "Go".
 # You can now access your booru by going here: [http://localhost/gelbooru/]
 # If you still run into errors after adding images, click on the WampServer icon on the system tray, go to "PHP > PHP settings" and uncheck "display errors".




= Grabber =

Launch Grabber, then open the options window and go to the "Commands" part. Set it to those values:

Initialization (note that the mysql version may vary)
{{{
"C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\bin\mysql.exe" --user=root --password= gelbooru
}}}
Image (with initialization)
{{{
INSERT INTO posts(creation_date, hash, image, height, width, ext, rating, tags, directory, active_date) VALUES(NOW(), "%md5%", "%md5%.%ext%", %height%, %width%, ".%ext%", "%rating%", " %all% ", "1", "20110619"); UPDATE post_count SET pcount=pcount+1 WHERE access_key="posts";
}}}
Tag (with initialization)
{{{
INSERT INTO tag_index(tag, index_count) VALUES("%tag%", 1) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE index_count = index_count+1;
}}}
Image
{{{
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /C copy "%path%" "C:\wamp\www\gelbooru\images\1\%md5%.%ext%"
}}}

Now, every time you save an image, a copy will be created in your local booru!



= Thumbnail issue =

If you test, you'll see that it doesn't works totally. In fact, no thumbnail is generated when doing this. Just visit [http://localhost/gelbooru/thumbs_fix.php http://localhost/gelbooru/thumbs_fix.php] to fix this. Note that you must be logged in as administrator in gelbooru to do this.
