#summary Keep a local gelbooru to browse your downloaded images.

== This wiki highlights a feature that will be implemented in Grabber v2.2, which is not yet released! So you won't be able to reproduce its content. =

= Operating system =
In this wiki, I'll consider that you're on Windows. But on Linux & other OSes, it should be pretty the same (cp instead of copy, LAMP instead of WAMP, etc.)

= Installing a local web server =

First, we're going to install WAMP, which contains everithing required to have a local web server.

Go [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/ here] and download the latest version of WAMP.

Then, install it: "Next", "I accept the agreement" > "Next", "Next", "Next", "Install". It will ask you for "PHP mail parameters". We don't care about them, so just leave the default values and click Next and launch WAMP.

= Installing Gelbooru =

So we have a working server installed. You can check that everything works visiting [http://127.0.0.1/ 127.0.0.1] or [http://localhost/ localhost].

Now, we must install Gelbooru. Go [http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=forum&s=view&id=99 here] and download the latest version from the 0.1 branch (0.1.`*`).

Then, extract it to "C:\Program Files\Wamp\www\gelbooru". You must now configure it and create its database.

Go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ http://localhost/phpmyadmin/]. Change the language if you want, then create a database named "gelbooru" with an "utf8_unicode_ci" Collation.

Now, open the file located at "C:\Program Files\Wamp\www\gelbooru\config.php" with a basic text editor.

Find the line :

{{{ $mysql_pass = "test"; }}}

And replace it by

{{{ $mysql_pass = ""; }}}

Replace

{{{ $mysql_db = "asdf"; }}}

By

{{{ $mysql_db = "gelbooru"; }}}

Replace

{{{ $site_url = "http://127.0.0.1/branches/0.1.10/0.1.10/"; }}}

By

{{{ $site_url = "http://localhost/gelbooru"; }}}

And finally replace

{{{ $site_url3 = "Default Booru"; }}}

By (you can change "Localbooru" by the name of your booru)

{{{ $site_url2 = $site_url3 = "Localbooru"; }}}

Now, go to [http://localhost/gelbooru/install/ http://localhost/gelbooru/install/] and register your admin account.

The installation is finished! You can now use your booru going [http://localhost/gelbooru/ here]. If you run into errors after adding images, click on the WAMP icon on the system tray, go to "PHP > PHP settings" and uncheck "display errors".
