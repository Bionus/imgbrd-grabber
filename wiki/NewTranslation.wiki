#summary How to create a new translation file

=Introduction=

If you're language is not available for the program, you can add if *very simply* (the fact that there are many steps is not relevant). The goal of this page is to tell you how to do this.



=How to create a new translation file=

  # Download the translations tools on the downloads page.
  # Unarchive it using winrar, 7-zip or whatever.
  # You will have a file named "en.ts" : it is the english translation file: duplicate it.
  # Rename the "your_translation_file.ts", replacing "your_translation_file" by the name of your language, for example "Deutsch".
  # Launch "linguist.exe"
  # Open ("File > Open..." or "Ctrl+O") the en.ts file and your language file.
  # A new window will pop-up: For the source language's language, set French, and for the country France. And for the target language, just put your language and country.
  # There will be a part in the window where you will have five fields : "Source text", "English translation", "English translator comment", "'Your language' translation" and "'Your language' translator comments".
  # The "only" thing you have to do know is to fill-up the "'Your language' translation" part, then mark item as done ("Translation > Done and Next", or just press "Ctrl+Return")
  # Once all the translations have been marked as done, save and quit.
  # Then, drag and drop your translation file on "lrelease.exe".
  # Another file will be created : "'Your language'.qm". Just move it to the "languages" directory in the Grabber's installation folder.



Once finished, dont hesitate sending me a mail with your translation file (the .ts one) at bio.nus@hotmail.fr, so I will add your translation to the downloads !
