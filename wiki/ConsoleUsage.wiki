#summary How to use the program's feature through command line.

= Introduction =

Starting 3.6.0 version, Grabber can be totally run through the command line.


= Compilation =

There is two ways to use the command line.

When compiling Grabber, just uncomment "CONFIG += use_cli" to set the CLI to be the default behavior. The downside is that running it in GUI mode with the "-g" or "--gui" command will pop up a console too if not run from a terminal already.

If you keep it commented or just use the precompiled version, Grabber will start with its GUI by default, which can be disabled with the "-c" or "--cli" commands.


= Commands =

In this part I'll consider that you are using the precompiled version, which has "CONFIG += use_cli" commented.
