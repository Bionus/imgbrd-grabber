#summary Detailed info about the filename option.



= Available tokens =
  * %artist%
  * %copyright%
  * %character%
  * %model% : boorus such as [http://behoimi.org/ Behoimi] use, adding to classical type, the "model" type.

  * %search% : search tags
  * %search_1%, %search_2%, %search_3%... : first/second/third/etc. tag of the search.
  * %filename% : image filename, as stored on the booru's server.
  * %rating%
  * %md5%
  * %id%
  * %website%
  * %height%
  * %width%
  * %ext%
  * %general%
  * %all% : all tags.
  * %allo% : do not use this unless you know what you're doing. It is the same as %all%, but without the removal of forbidden characters and any treatment (so some images just won't save).

= Custom tokens =
You can also add custom tokens. To do so, go to the options, "save" part and "custom tokens" subpart. Then just click the button "Add a new custom token" and choose a name and tags that will be searched (separate them with spaces). Any tags in this list found in the image will be placed into your token. For example if an image got tags "a", "b", "c", "d" and your tags list for token "test" is "a c e", "%test%" will be replaced by "a c".

_Note: custom tokens with an already used name (such as %character%) will be used first.

= Conditionals =
You can use conditionals in your filename, using strict inequality signs (< and >).
== Token conditionals ==
If any token found in the conditional does not exist or is empty, nothing into it will be displayed.
Since an example is worth a thousand words:
{{{
image - <%artist% some text <%nothing% another text> test><<%character% some text> text %nothing%> %md5%.%ext%
}}}
Assuming the image contains both an artist and a character, it will return:
{{{
image - %artist% some text  test %md5%.%ext%
}}}
If the image doesn't have any artist, it will be:
{{{
image -  %md5%.%ext%
}}}
== Tag conditionals ==
You can also test directly the presence of a tag surrounding him with quotes. For example:
{{{
image - <image contains the tag "solo"><"group" is one of the image tags> %md5%.%ext%
}}}
If the image contains the "solo" tag, it will return:
{{{
image - image contains the tag solo  %md5%.%ext%
}}}
If the image contains the "group" tag:
{{{
image -  group is one of the image tags %md5%.%ext%
}}}
If, for some obscure reason, it have both:
{{{
image - image contains the tag solo group is one of the image tags %md5%.%ext%
}}}
If, it does not have solo nor group:
{{{
image -   %md5%.%ext%
}}}
