#summary How to make the program portable.

= Introduction =

If you want to be able to use the program anywhere without installation, for example on an USB drive, you can make it a portable application.


= How-to =

By default, settings and executable files are located in two different locations. Settings are in:
{{{
"C:/Users/%USERNAME%/Grabber"
}}}
And the executable files are in:
{{{
# For 32-bit systems
"C:/Program Files/Grabber"
# For 64-bit systems
"C:/Program Files (x86)/Grabber"
}}}
To make the application portable, you just have to copy the contents of both of these folders in another directory.
