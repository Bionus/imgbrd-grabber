# Telemetry

## Introduction
In order to better understand the usage Grabber's users do of the program, there is a very light telemetry integrated.

It helps understand which direction to take for the program.

## What is sent and why
:warning: Note that everything is anonymous, and that what you search/download/etc. is never sent.

### Screen resolution
To help improve the UI and know how many elements can/should be present on the screen at the same time.

For example, if it is clear that most users use the program on a small screen, an effort will have to be made to ensure everything is properly usable on small screens. On the other hands, if there are a lot of 4K users, high-DPI screen support should be improved.

### Country and language
To know which translations to work on, both for the program and the documentation.

### Operating system
To know which platforms mainly use the prorgam. Useful to see where to improve testing and feature support.

### Grabber's version
To measure penetration, and see how many users "hold on" to old versions instead of updating.

### An event on startup
To understand when the program is used, and how many active users there are.

Otherwise, the only way to know the popularity of the program is to count downloads, which has proven inefficient.


## How to disable telemetry
The sending of anonymouse usage data can easily be disabled in the options. Just open them, then in the "General" section of the options, uncheck "Send anonymous usage data".
