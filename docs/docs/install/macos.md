    ```

### Via the DMG
1. Go to the latest release [here](https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/releases/latest)
2. Download the `.dmg` file
3. Open the `.dmg` file
4. Drag and drop the `Grabber.app` file to your `Applications` directory
5. Eject and remove the `.dmg` file
6. Launch Grabber via Launchpad

!!! warning

    Grabber is not a verified Apple application, so you might get a "the developer cannot be verified" error. In that case, you should open Finder, go to your `Applications` directory, then right click `Grabber.app` then choose "Open". Then, you'll be able to choose "Open" to start Grabber anyway. You only need to do this once. More information [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
