## Based on an existing source type

If the site you're trying to add uses the same source type (e.g. Gelbooru 0.1) as already-supported sites, you're in luck as it should be easy to add it to Grabber.

1. Start the program.
2. Click on the "Sources" button at the bottom of a search tab
3. Click on the "Add" button at the bottom of the window that just popped up
4. Fill the Url field, and leave the "Guess" checkbox checked
5. If the program fails to guess the source type, uncheck "Guess", and choose a source type manually in the list


## Create a new source type

If none of the available sources types match the website you want to add, you'll have to create one yourself.

You can see [this documentation](source.md) for more info.
