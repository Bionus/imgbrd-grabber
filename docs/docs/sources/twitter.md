!!! warning

    Twitter results are post-filtered to remove tweets without images. As such, when searching for an account with lots of tweets without media, you might get less results than expected, sometimes even an empty page. In that case, just go to the next page. It is also recommended to increase the images per page setting to see more results at once.

### Search syntax

* `Username`: get all media for a given user handle
* `user_id:ID`: get all media for a given user ID
* `list_id:ID`: get all media for a given list ID
* `retweets:{yes,no}`: whether to also get media from retweets (default: `yes`)
* `replies:{yes,no}`: whether to also get media from replies (default: `yes`)
