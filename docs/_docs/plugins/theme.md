# Themes

You can add Qt themes to Grabber, using [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) to customize all parts of the UI.

To add a new theme to Grabber, just create a folder in the `themes` directory (located in `C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Bionus/Grabber` on Windows) with the name of your theme. Then create a `style.css` file inside that new folder. You just have to write your CSS into that file!

The documentation for Qt's stylesheet can be found here:
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/stylesheet-reference.html

If you made a nice theme that you feel could be added to the default Grabber installation, feel free to propose it to the team by making a pull request!
