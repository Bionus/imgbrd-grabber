# Introduction

Source registries are JSON files pointing to source files. They are used to add sources easily to Grabber.

They can be hosted anywhere an can point to sources anywhere. The official source registry is hosted in Github, in the [sources-metadata](https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/releases/tag/sources-metadata) release.


# Format

```json
{
    "name": "...",
    "home": "https://...",
    "url": "https://...",
    "sources": [{
        "slug": "...",
        "name": "...",
        "hash": "...",
        "lastCommit": {
            "hash": "...",
            "author": "...",
            "date": "...",
            "subject": "..."
