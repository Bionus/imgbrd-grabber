title: Portable version
---


## Introduction

If you want to be able to use the program anywhere without installation, for example on an USB drive, you can make it a portable application.


## How-to

By default, settings and executable files are located in two different locations. Settings are in:
```
C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/Bionus/Grabber
```
Or, if you are using an old version of the program:
```
"C:/Users/%USERNAME%/Grabber"
```
And the executable files are in:
```
"C:/Program Files/Grabber"
```
To make the application portable, you just have to copy the contents of both of these folders in another directory.
