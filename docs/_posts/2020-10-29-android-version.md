You can find more details here, such as screenshots, status, roadmap, etc:

Or if you just want to download it, here's the link!  
[Grabber_nightly_qml.apk](https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/releases/download/nightly-github/Grabber_nightly_qml.apk)

It's still rough around the edges, but the basics are there! Feel free to comment here or on Github if you have any feedback, suggestions, requests, etc!

Best,  
Bionus
