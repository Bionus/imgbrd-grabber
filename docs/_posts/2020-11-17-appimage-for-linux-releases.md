Hey everyone!

&nbsp;

Just a heads-up that I'm currently in the process of testing a new format for Linux releases for Grabber, namely using _AppImage_ instead of _tar.gz_.

You can find more info about the _AppImage_ format on [appimage.org](https://appimage.org/).

This change is quite new and as such is still only available for Github nightlies, and there might be a few issues here and there. If that's the case, please do ping me by mail or on Github!

You can find the download here:  
<https://github.com/Bionus/imgbrd-grabber/releases/nightly-github>

The next official release should also have an AppImage file available if nightlies are not your thing.

&nbsp;

Best,  
Bionus
