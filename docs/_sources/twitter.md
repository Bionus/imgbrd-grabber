# Twitter

The only known working URL for this source is:
* <https://api.twitter.com>

**⚠️ Twitter results are post-filtered to remove tweets without images. As such, when searching for an account with lots of tweets without media, you might get less results than expected, sometimes even an empty page. In that case, just go to the next page. It is also recommended to increase the images per page setting to see more results at once. ⚠️**

## Search syntax

* `Username`: get all media for a given user
* `retweets:{yes,no}`: whether to also get media from retweets (default: `yes`)
* `replies:{yes,no}`: whether to also get media from replies (default: `yes`)
