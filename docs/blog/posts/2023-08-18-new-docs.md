# New docs

Hello everyone!

&nbsp;

The documentation website for Grabber now has a new look!

I felt that the old look led to many people simply not reading the docs, and the navigation wasn't all that intuitive.

<!-- more -->

The documentation website, as well as the homepage and blog, are now based on the excellent [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). It allows for not only easier-to-read docs, but also easier-to-write documentation! Hopefully this will lead to less confused users.

Some new features include:

- A better theme
- A search input
- Table of contents navigation on the right
- A dark/light mode switch

For those that did not have the chance to see the previous look, here is a before and after of the homepage:

![Before](../../assets/img/blog/old-homepage.png){ width="49%" }
![After](../../assets/img/blog/new-homepage.png){ width="49%" }

Thanks again to everyone using and supporting Grabber everyday!

Best,
